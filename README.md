# Open Journal Template

This is a template for Github-hosted open journals. To create a new 
journal:

 1. Create an [account on Github][gh-account] and login.

 2. Click on the `Use this template` green button above and select the 
    Github organization or user where the journal will live.

 3. Remove these instructions from the `README.md` file and replace 
    them for the description of your journal. We show an example below 
    where we use `<OJ>` as the name of your domain of study.
